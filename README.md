# best-practice-java-spring-boot

This is an open-source template project based on Spring Boot (Java).

## Background and Purpose

The goal of this template is to provide a best practice example that can be easily referenced or directly used when incorporating additional components into a simple Spring Boot application architecture. It is also intended for personal use to streamline project setup.

This template leverages various elements such as:

- Exception Handling with `ExceptionHandler` and `ControllerAdvice`
- Request Interception with `Interceptor`
- Database Interaction with JPA and Hibernate
- Security Implementation

Additionally, it includes comprehensive configurations for deploying Spring Boot services in a cloud (AWS) microservices architecture (MSA) environment. This includes:

- Dockerfile
- AWS ECS Task Definition
- CodeBuild Specification
- CodeDeploy Specification

By utilizing this template, developers can quickly set up a robust Spring Boot application with all necessary components for cloud deployment.
